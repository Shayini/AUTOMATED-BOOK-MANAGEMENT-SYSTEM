Install Arduino.

(I have used Arduino UNO for Step 1,2,3 and changed to Arduino Mega for other steps...
	When changing consider about the pins for RFID, LCD, and WIFI MODULE... Check the pin setup for these components)

Step 1: Line Follower => ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsGG6-vXaXo )
	- Connect the circuit as in the design1.png
	- Adjust the sensors
	
Step 2: RFID + LCD => ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlrfSv6_AWw )
	- Extract and Move the 'rfid-master' file in the 'Step 2 - RFID + LCD/Library' to 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries'
	- Connect the circuit as in the Design2_Using_ArduinoUNO.png
	- Upload & Run the file 'rfid_write_book_data.ino' file in 'Step 2 - RFID + LCD/1 - rfid_write_book_data/rfid_write_book_data' to add data to the tag
	- Upload & Run the file 'rfid_read_book_data.ino' file in 'Step 2 - RFID + LCD/2 - rfid_read_book_data/rfid_read_book_data' to read data from the tag
	- Upload & Run the file 'rfid_delete_book_data.ino' file in 'Step 2 - RFID + LCD/3 - rfid_delete_book_data/rfid_delete_book_data' to delete data from the tag
	- If every thing runs well finally,
		=> Upload & Run the file 'RFID_Modify_Code_for_LCD.ino' file in 'Step 2 - RFID + LCD/4 - RFID_Modify_Code_for_LCD/RFID_Modify_Code_for_LCD'

Step 3: Wi-Fi Module => (  )
	- Connect the circuit as in the Design3_Using_ArduinoUNO.png
	- sample AT commands to get wifi module IP address--------------------------------------------------------
	- Change the 'WIFI_SSID' and 'PASSWORD' value as your wifi ssid and password
	- If needed change the 'host' value as your computers IP address(for localhost)
	- Change the 'book id' which you have to update the status of that book, in the place where the function is called
	- In the java backend add the wifi module IP address in the @CrossOrigin raw in the BookController.java file as @CrossOrigin(origins = {"http://localhost:8081", "http://<wifi_module_IP_address>"})
	- Upload & Run the java backend, MySQL Workbench and the 'Wi-Fi_Module.ino' file in the 'Step 3 - Wi-Fi Module/Wi-Fi_Module'
	- Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE
	- If every thing runs well, You can see that the perticular book details will be updated in the server
	
Step 4: RFID + Wi-Fi Module => (  )
	- Combine the circuit in Step 2 & Step 3
	- If every thing is connected well finally,
		=> Upload & Run the file 'RFID_LCD_Modify_Code_for_Wi_Fi_Module.ino' file in 'Step 4 - RFID + LCD Modify Code for Wi-Fi Module\RFID_LCD_Modify_Code_for_Wi_Fi_Module'

Step 5: Connecting with Line follower => (  )
	- Combine the circuit in Step 1 & Step 4
	- If every thing is connected well finally,
		=> Upload & Run the file 'Connect_with_Line_follower.ino' file in 'Step 5 - Connecting with Line follower\Connect_with_Line_follower'

Step 6: Shortest Path => (  )
	- It is a code for finding shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm
	- Upload & Run the file 'Shortest_Path.ino' file in 'Step 6 - Shortest Path\Shortest_Path'

Step 6: Line follower with Shortest Path => (  )
	- (Combine the codes in Step 5 & Step 6)
	- Upload & Run the file 'Line_follower_with_Shortest_Path.ino' file in 'Step 7 - Line follower with Shortest Path\Line_follower_with_Shortest_Path'
